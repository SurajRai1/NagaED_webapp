Summary of the Flask Web Application
What is it?

A simple web application that helps users send messages through a "Contact Us" form and manage a list of courses.
Main Features:


Contact Us Form: Users can fill out a form with their name, email, and a message.
When they submit the form, their information is saved, and they see a message saying their message was sent.
Course Management API:

Add Courses: Users can add new courses to a list. Each course has a title, description, and duration.
View All Courses: Users can see all the courses that have been added.
Get a Specific Course: Users can look up a course by its position in the list (like the first course, second course, etc.).
Update a Course: Users can change the information about a course.
Delete a Course: Users can remove a course from the list.
How It Works:

The app uses a tool called Flask to create the web pages and handle user requests.
Users interact with the app through a web browser or a program called Postman.
The information about courses is stored in a list, and each course is kept in the order it was added.
Why is it useful?

This app makes it easy for people to contact the company and helps manage information about educational courses in a simple way.
